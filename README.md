Ernest & Young (EY) and UMD DOTS have worked in collaboration with eachother for nearly 5 years to obtain a model/automated based solution to the for the frequent parking changes UMD would be exposed to, and the delima it posses.

Due to the regular flucuations that would occur, and the intensive labor costs that would be needed to prevent this confusion from becoming inefficently handled by non-human resources, the regular changes would leave many people with citations they could've avoided.

During the I4C hackathon, my team and I were tasked with finding a solution to this problem that 52% of the EY and UMD team belived to be impossible.

<h2>App Details</h2>

We developed an app that was able to retrive information based on the current student/guest/faculty members' currnent profile information, that being thier authroity level, permits, etc, and combined it with recent campus conditions, such as president parking lot reservations, or home comings. We filter both through discrete universal conditions such as permit permissions, as well as basing it on directly written information recent campus news or emails.

Our promise is once UMD develops and API that allows for the retrival of all campus news relating to offical parking changes, we can directly feed those results automatically into our app's LLM and have an automatic system that will alert the UMD body of parking changes immedeately, thus constructing a solution the EY and UMD's problem
